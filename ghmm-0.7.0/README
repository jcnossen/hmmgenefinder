normal build instructions:
==========================

The generic build instructions can be found at INSTALL.

Some mathematic features are included from gsl, the GNU scientific library,
it is available at sources.redhat.com/gsl . All versions until gsl-0.7 are
supported now.

The c++ part of this library needs xmlio, that can be found at
xmlio.sourceforge.net. xmlio depends on expat, that is also available
at sourceforge.

gsl and expat are distributed with Redhat 7.1 Linux.

so, configure is called with:

./configure --prefix=/as/you/like/it --with-xmlio=/where/xmlio/is/installed \
--with-gsl=/alternative/gsl/installation

build from cvs:
===============

0. you need automake, autoconf and m4 from ftp://ftp.gnu.org

1. call autogen.sh
   (ignore messages like:
    automake: configure.in: installing `./mkinstalldirs'
        error while copying
   )

2. continue with normal build instructions as written in INSTALL

3. tests require DejaGNU (and this requires expect, a tcl based language)

experimental features:
======================

if some things are experimental and not portable, you can use 

#if __EXPERIMNETAL__ == 1

achim_s_suspicious_code;

#endif

to avoid confusion.
Activate this code by including the option --enable-experimental=1 in ./configure !

So allocate your number by appending it to the following list:

0: switched on for 0 and all strings that are not a number
   it will be compiled with --enable-experimental
1: achim (xml)
2: achim (cleanup and compartibility)
3: bernd wichern (sviterbi implementation)

If this code is working, but not tested by everybody, use

#ifdef __EXPERIMENTAL__

code_to_be_tested;

#endif

and everybody can use your feature by setting --enable-experimental .
